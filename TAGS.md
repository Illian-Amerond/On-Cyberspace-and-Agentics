# Tag Registry

This file defines all active ledger tags for the *On Cyberspace and Agentics* workspace.  
It is parsed at compile time to validate tag usage in sections and ledgers.

- The tag’s “ledger” (ONTO / EPI / META) is defined by its section in this file.
- Always update this registry before introducing a new tag into `.tex` source.
